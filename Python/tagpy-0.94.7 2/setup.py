          TagPy is a set of Python bindings for Scott Wheeler's 
          `TagLib <http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html>`_. 
          It builds upon `Boost.Python <http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/>`_, 
          a wrapper generation library which is part of the renowned Boost 
          set of C++ libraries.

          Just like TagLib, TagPy can:

          * read and write ID3 tags of version 1 and 2, with many supported frame types
            for version 2 (in MPEG Layer 2 and MPEG Layer 3, FLAC and MPC),
          * access Xiph Comments in Ogg Vorbis Files and Ogg Flac Files,
          * access APE tags in Musepack and MP3 files.

          All these features have their own specific interfaces, but 
          TagLib's generic tag reading and writing mechanism is also 
          supported. It comes with a bunch of examples.
