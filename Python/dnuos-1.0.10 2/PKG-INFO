Description: 
        Dnuos is a console program that creates lists of music collections, based on
        directory structure.
        
        For example, a list might look like this::
        
        Album/Artist                       |  Size | Type | Quality
        ===========================================================
        Ambient                            |       |      |
        Alva Noto                      |       |      |
        2001 - Transform           | 70.9M | MP3  | -V2
        2004 - Transrapid          | 30.2M | MP3  | -aps
        2005 - Transspray          | 31.7M | MP3  | -aps
        2005 - Transvision         | 32.3M | MP3  | -aps
        Alva Noto and Ryuichi Sakamoto |       |      |
        2002 - Vrioon              | 72.6M | MP3  | -aps
        2005 - Insen               | 99.1M | MP3  | 320 C
        2006 - Revep               | 27.9M | MP3  | -V2n
        
        The list format is completely customizable and can be plain text or HTML.
        
        Dnuos supports MP3, AAC, Musepack, Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC audio files. Quality
        profile detection is also supported, including `LAME quality preset`_
        information.
        
        Audio file information is saved to disk after a list is made for the first
        time, making subsequent lists much faster to generate. Only audio files and
        directories that have been changed since the last list was made are
        analyzed.
        
        Dnuos is based on code from Oidua_. Oidua makes similar lists, but is much
        older, has fewer features, and is no longer maintained.
