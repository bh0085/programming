Installation Instructions
-------------------------

First of all, install the following dependencies:
  
  1. python (tested with 2.4)
     Standard python 2.3 or later should work.
     
     -> http://www.python.org/

  2. libdiscid (tested with 0.1.0)
     Any version above 0.1.0 should do.

     -> http://musicbrainz.org/products/libdiscid/

  3. ctypes (tested with 0.9.6 and 0.9.9.3)
     Version 0.9.0 or later should work, which is included in recent
     linux distributions. This is required for DiscID calculation.
     Note that python 2.5 already comes with ctypes.

     -> http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/


Installation works using python's standard distutils (on most systems,
root permissions are required):

    python setup.py install


Optionally, API documentation can be generated using epydoc. This command
runs epydoc (http://epydoc.sf.net) which creates a 'html' directory containing
the documentation:

    python setup.py docs
