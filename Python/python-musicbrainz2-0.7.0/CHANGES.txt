Changes in 0.7.0:

  * Added ISRC support (patch by Alastair Porter).
  * Added rating support (patch by Peter Schnebel).
  * Added a trackCount parameter to ReleaseFilter (#3781).
  * Changed ReleaseFilter and TrackFilter to accept URIs for artistId
    and releaseId (#4746).
  * Fixed serialization of relations in MbXmlWriter (#4394).
  * Fixed a crash on 64-bit systems in libdiscid bindings (Luks).

Changes in 0.6.0:

  * Added folksonomy tagging support (mostly by Philipp Wolfer, #3285):

      - Added getUserTags() and submitUserTags() to webservice.Query.
      - Added an example script: examples/folksonomytags.py.
  * Relation.DIR_BOTH is no longer used since the web service doesn't 
    know bidirectional relations. If no direction is returned, the client
    library maps it to Relation.DIR_NONE. Note that this is *not* entirely
    backwards compatible (#3034).
  * Added "WaxCylinder" and "PianoRoll" to ReleaseEvent (#3231).

      - Changed getTracks() to return a list of TrackResult objects.

      - Renamed getCountryId() to getCountry()
      - Renamed __init__()'s 'countryId' parameter to 'country'.

  * API changes in model.Artist:
      - Renamed setType()'s 'typeUri' parameter to 'type_'.

  * API changes in model.ArtistAlias:
      - Renamed __init__()'s and setType()'s 'typeUri' parameter to 'type_'.

  * API changes to wsxml.Metadata:
      - Removed getArtistList(), getReleaseList(), getTrackList()
      - Added getArtistResults(), getReleaseResults(), and getTrackResults(),
	returning ArtistResult, ReleaseResult, and TrackResult objects,
	respectively.

  * General API changes:
      - Classes are now derived from 'object' (new-style classes).
      - Marked all supposedly private attributes as private ('attr' -> '_attr').
      - Marked the DOM utility functions in wsxml.py as private.

  * All getter and setter methods are now exposed as properties, too.

  * Added the class wsxml.MbXmlWriter which generates MMD XML.

  * Added TYPE_PERSON and TYPE_GROUP constans to model.Artist.

    and release type IDs to printable strings.

  * Modules now have __all__, which makes 'import *' possible (but don't do it).

  * The country code in model.ReleaseEvent is now optional. This is due to
    the server which doesn't provide country codes for release collection
    queries (and just the earliest date).

  * Added more example code and improved the documentation.
