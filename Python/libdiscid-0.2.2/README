A Library for creating MusicBrainz DiscIDs
------------------------------------------

libdiscid is a library for creating MusicBrainz DiscIDs from audio CDs.
It reads a CD's table of contents (TOC) and generates an identifier which
can be used to lookup the CD at MusicBrainz (http://musicbrainz.org).
Additionally, it provides a submission URL for adding the DiscID to the
database.

The interface of this library is new, but the DiscID algorithm and the
operating system dependent CD-ROM/DVD-ROM access code have been ported
from libmusicbrainz version 2. 


NOTE: This library is also bundled with libmusicbrainz version 3 or later.
      If you already have libmusicbrainz installed, there is no need to
      install libdiscid separately.
