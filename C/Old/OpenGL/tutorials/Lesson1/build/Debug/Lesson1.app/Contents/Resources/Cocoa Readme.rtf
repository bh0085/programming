\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 This is the Mac OS X Cocoa port of NeHe's Tutorial #1 (http://nehe.gamedev.net/)\

\f1\b0 \
Implements all the features of Jeff Molofee's tutorial, using NSOpenGLView,\
including full-screen capability.\
\
There are two classes, 
\f2\i Lesson01Controller 
\f1\i0 and 
\f2\i Lesson01View
\f1\i0 .  The view is a subclass of NSOpenGLView, and implements all the necessary drawing.  By default, it creates a window 640x480, and creates a pixel format of 16 color bits and 16 depth bits.  Full-screen mode switches to 800x600, same color and depth bits.  This should work on any OS X machine.\
\
One of the big differences architecturally is this implementation uses a rendering timer to update the view, instead of updating when idle.\
